 RSTAGS
----------------------------

an RSTAG represents a reservation station tag. it consists of 8 bits:

[7: null tag bit] [6: ready-in-rob bit] [5:0: rob entry number]

`RSTAG_NULL is defined as 8'b11111111, and it is customary to check against this for a valid tag, instead of checking bit 7 of the rs tag (though that would work also).
